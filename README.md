Hi, I’m Nash (@ndbk99), they/them, and I'm a research assistant at Yale! I work with Dr. John Wettlaufer (Yale) and Ludovico Giorgini (NORDITA) in applied math & climate science, and my current research focuses on noise analysis and stochastic modeling of climate data from the EPICA ice core.

I am nonbinary and passionate about queer issues & social justice, as well as music & sound studies.

Email me at nash(dot)keyes(at)yale(dot)edu if you are interested in my work, want to collaborate, or just want to talk!
