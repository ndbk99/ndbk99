Hi, I’m Nash (@ndbk99), they/them, and I'm a post-bacc researcher at Yale. This summer (2021), I'm working with Dr. Mary-Louise Timmermans (Yale) and Isabela le Bras (WHOI) on Arctic Ocean volumetric T-S diagrams and information entropy. In the fall, I will be continuing my senior thesis work with Dr. John Wettlaufer (Yale) and Ludovico Giorgini (NORDITA) in applied math & climate science, focusing on noise analysis and stochastic modeling of climate data from the EPICA ice core. 

I am nonbinary and passionate about queer issues & social justice, and I've done some trans community work at Yale and in New Haven. I'm also interested in music & sound studies - I play guitar and cello and am trying to get into composing. 

Contact me at nash(dot)keyes(at)yale(dot)edu, and connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/nash-keyes/.
