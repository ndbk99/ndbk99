Hi, I’m Nash (@ndbk99), they/them, and I'm a research assistant at Yale! I work with Dr. John Wettlaufer (Yale) and Ludovico Giorgini (NORDITA) in applied math & climate science, and my current research focuses on noise analysis and stochastic modeling of climate data from the EPICA ice core. This summer (2021) though, I'm working with Dr. Mary-Louise Timmermans (Yale) and Isabela le Bras (WHOI) on Arctic Ocean volumetric T-S diagrams and information entropy. You can connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/nash-keyes/.

I am nonbinary and passionate about queer issues & social justice, and I've done some trans community work at Yale and in New Haven. I'm also interested in music & sound studies - I play guitar and cello and am trying to get into composing. Find my very-early-stages SoundCloud at https://soundcloud.com/fallstreak-guitar/tracks.

Email me at nash(dot)keyes(at)yale(dot)edu if you are interested in my work, want to collaborate, or just want to talk!
